# EazyBids
Eazybids (Tender Management System)
1. Introduction & Objectives of the Project
The EazyBids Tender Management System is a web-based application that automates and streamlines the tendering process for companies. Its main objectives are to provide an efficient platform for companies to create and manage tenders, enable vendors to easily place bids and track their status, ensure transparent bid evaluation, and offer a user-friendly interface. By utilizing modern technologies like Java, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the system aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in the tendering process, benefiting both companies and vendors involved.
2. Advantage
➢ Streamlined Tendering Process: The automated platform of EazyBids simplifies the tendering process, saving time and effort for companies. Creating and managing tenders becomes more efficient, reducing manual tasks and paperwork
➢ Efficient Vendor Management: The system allows administrators to maintain an empanelled list of vendors for each tender. This organized vendor management ensures that only eligible vendors can bid, leading to better bid relevance and quality.
➢ Easy Bid Placement for Vendors: vendors can effortlessly view active tenders, submit bids, and track their status. The user-friendly interface and clear guidelines make it convenient for vendors to participate in the bidding process.
➢ Transparency in Bid Evaluation: By providing administrators with access to all bids for each tender, the system ensures a fair and transparent bid evaluation process. This transparency enhances trust among vendors and promotes healthy competition.

5. Modules
➢ User Authentication and Authorization:
• Allows users (administrators and vendors) to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
• Provides role-based access control to ensure that only authorized actions are performed.
➢ Vendor Management:
• Enables administrators to add, view, edit, and deactivate vendor profiles.
• Manages the empanelled list of vendors for each tender.
➢ Tender Management:
• Allows administrators to create, view, and manage tenders.
• Provides details of active tenders, including the service/merchandise required and the deadline for bid submission.
➢ Bid Management & History:
• Allows vendors to view all active tenders and place bids against eligible tenders.
• Tracks the status of vendor bids, indicating whether a bid is selected or not.
• Provides a record of all bids submitted by a vendor.
6. Security and Validation Checks
➢ Authentication and Authorization:
• Implement a secure user login system to ensure that only authenticated users (Administrator and Vendors) can access their respective functionalities.
• Use password hashing and salting techniques to store user passwords securely in the database.
➢ Role-Based Access Control: Allow administrators and vendors access to their relevant functionalities.
➢ Vendor Input Validation: Validate vendor bids and tender responses.
7. Scope of Future Application
➢ Bid Comparison Tool:
• Develop a tool that allows administrators to compare multiple bids for the same tender side-by-side, helping them make informed decisions while selecting the winning bid.
➢ Security Enhancements:
• Regularly update and enhance the system's security features to safeguard sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and protect against potential cyber threats.
8. Conclusion
The EazyBids Tender Management System provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for companies and vendors to manage the tendering process seamlessly. With the automated system, administrators can easily create and manage tenders, while vendors can submit their bids and track their status effortlessly. The utilization of modern web technologies and a robust back-end ensures a smooth experience for all users involved in the tender management process.
